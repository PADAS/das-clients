# das-clients
Client libraries, user documentation and examples for interacting with a DAS API.

## Python Client
Our python client includes some essential functions for posting observations and events to a DAS system. See the bottom of the dasclient.py file for some advice on using it.

## .NET Client
The .NET client is a very bare bones implementation suitable for posting observations. A bespoke sample is provided in VB.Net.
